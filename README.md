# NCTU ICSE 2015 Spring
# Computer Vision

This repository contains my two homework and the final project which is about cat face recognition using haar-like feature with adaboost and SVM algo.


## Homework 1
3D image reconstruction

## Homework2
SIFT feature + RANSAC to find correspondance points
By using the correspondance points to get the homography matrix and then do the image transformation which contains rotation and translation.

# Final Project

This project's idea is mainly from my teammate [@Phoebewawa](https://github.com/phoebewawa) trying the develop a cat face recognition system.
In this repository, mainly contains my haar-like feature extraction and i used haarcascade to train my cat face data.
I'm using OpenCV 2.4 to generate the xml file for my training result which are bunch of cat face.
And for the SVM part, we use matlab for implemetation, and the work of SVM is owing to my teammate, Phoebe.
